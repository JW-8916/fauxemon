Hello! This is my Senior research project for my study at Mount Saint Joseph University. This project is meant to put together a lot of the things I learned
and relate it back to the thing that made me want to learn programming to begin with: Pokemon! I've been doing other projects related to pokemon in the past,
and I wanted to put it all together here! 

This project is open source, the only information not available is the database and it's credentials
